# zeusconfig
Zeus is Kevin's personal laptop

Kevin gets work done on Zeus

Kevin cannot afford to screw up Zeus

Kevin is smart (kinda)

Kevin backs up all his config files so that in the event of a disaster (eg: Zombies ate Kevin's computer), Kevin can simply buy another computer, download his config files, and continue working (Kevin has no life)
